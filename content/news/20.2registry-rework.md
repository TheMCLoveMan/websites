# DRAFT BLOG POST - NOT YET RELEASED <!-- TODO: remove this -->

## Introduction
A big update to the registry system was just released in NeoForge version 20.2.X. <!-- TODO add neoforge registry release version-->
Our primary goal is to simplify the code as much as possible,
and align it with the registry system in vanilla Minecraft.

This blog post will go through the most important changes that were made,
to act as a migration guide for modders.

This rework is the first of the three big reworks to land
after [our initial 20.2 release](../20.2release).
The other two systems that will receive an overhaul in the coming weeks
are **capabilities** and **networking**.
Once these also land we will be aiming for a 20.2 stable release.

## Using the registries
Previously, the NeoForge registry system was completely separate from vanilla's.
Now, we use the existing registry system in vanilla, with a few additions that are relevant to mod support.

This means that `IForgeRegistry` is replaced by the vanilla `Registry`.
NeoForge adds a few methods to the vanilla `Registry` type via `IRegistryExtension`.
Here is an overview of the changed methods:
| `IForgeRegistry`               | `Registry`                                 |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `getValue(ResourceLocation)`   | `get(ResourceLocation)`                    |
| `getKeys()`                    | `keySet()`                                 |
| `getValues().stream()`         | `stream()`                                 |
| `getHolder(T)Optional<Holder>` | `wrapAsHolder(T)Holder?`                   |
| `tags()`                       | Use `getTag(TagKey)` and the HolderSet API |

The registries that are defined by Minecraft itself should now be accessed via `BuiltInRegistries`:
```diff
- ForgeRegistries.ITEMS.getValue(new ResourceLocation("minecraft:diamond"));
+ BuiltInRegistries.ITEM.get(new ResourceLocation("minecraft:diamond"));
```

The registries that are defined by NeoForge are accessible via `NeoForgeRegistries`.
They are not wrapped in a `Supplier` anymore, and can be used directly:
```diff
- ForgeRegistries.FLUID_TYPES.get().getValue(new ResourceLocation("mymod:fancyfluid"));
+ NeoForgeRegistries.FLUID_TYPES.get(new ResourceLocation("mymod:fancyfluid"));
```

## Registration
Registration still happens in the `RegisterEvent`,
and we still recommend that modders use `DeferredRegister` to abstract over the events.

`RegistryObject` was replaced by `DeferredHolder`, which implements vanilla's `Holder` interface.
When registering objects to a deferred register, we recommended two options:
- If you don't need any of the `Holder` functions, you can use a `Supplier` for the type of your field.
- Otherwise, use `DeferredHolder` with the two generic parameters
(one for the registry and one for your object type).

Here are is an example:
```diff
  private static final DeferredRegister<Enchantment> ENCHANTMENTS = DeferredRegister.create(Registries.ENCHANTMENT, "mymod");

- public static final RegistryObject<Enchantment> MAGIC =
-         ENCHANTMENTS.register("magic", () -> new MagicEnchantment(/* create enchantment */));
 // Supplier only:
+ public static final Supplier<MagicEnchantment> MAGIC =
+         ENCHANTMENTS.register("magic", () -> new MagicEnchantment(/* create enchantment */));
  // Access to both Holder and the exact object type:
+ public static final DeferredHolder<Enchantment, MagicEnchantment> MAGIC =
+         ENCHANTMENTS.register("magic", () -> new MagicEnchantment(/* create enchantment */));
```

NeoForge also provides `DeferredHolder` and `DeferredRegister` specializations for items and blocks
that implement `ItemLike`. For example:
```java
private static final DeferredRegister.Items ITEMS = DeferredRegister.createItems("mymod");

public static final ItemLike MY_ITEM = ITEMS.register("myitem", () -> new MyItem(/* create item */));
public static final DeferredItem<MyItem> ANOTHER_ITEM = ITEMS.register("another_item", () -> new MyItem(/* create item */));
```

As usual, don't forget to pass your mod bus to your `DeferredRegister`s:
```java
@Mod("mymod")
public class MyMod {
    // In case you missed it, mod constructors can now receive a number of optional arguments,
    // including the mod's event bus. Unrelated to registries, but still pretty cool. ;)
    public MyMod(IEventBus modEventBus) {
        ENCHANTMENTS.register(modEventBus);
        ITEMS.register(modEventBus);
    }
}
```

## Custom registries
Custom registries are created with a `RegistryBuilder`, and must be registered to the `NewRegistryEvent`.
They can now be held in static fields, just like the registries in `BuiltInRegistries` or `NeoForgeRegistries`.

Here is a registration example, using the helper methods provided by `DeferredRegister`:
```java
// Create a registry key - we don't have a registry yet so give the key to DeferredRegister.
public static final ResourceKey<Registry<Custom>> CUSTOM_REGISTRY_KEY =
        ResourceKey.createRegistryKey(new ResourceLocation("mymod:custom"));
// Create the DeferredRegister with our registry key.
private static final DeferredRegister<CUSTOM> CUSTOMS =
        DeferredRegister.create(CUSTOM_REGISTRY_KEY, "mymod");

// We can register objects as usual...
public static final Holder<Custom> CUSTOM_OBJECT =
        CUSTOMS.register("custom_object", () -> new Custom());

// And here is how to create the registry!
public static final Registry<Custom> CUSTOM_REGISTRY =
        CUSTOMS.makeRegistry(builder -> /* use builder to configure registry if needed */);

// Remember to register CUSTOMS in the mod constructor!
```

Another way is to directly create the registry with a `RegistryBuilder`, and manually register it:
```java
// We still need a registry key.
public static final ResourceKey<Registry<Custom>> CUSTOM_REGISTRY_KEY =
        ResourceKey.createRegistryKey(new ResourceLocation("mymod:custom"));
// Create the registry directly...
public static final Register<Custom> CUSTOM_REGISTRY = new RegistryBuilder<>(CUSTOM_REGISTRY_KEY)
    // configure the builder if you want, for example with .sync(true)
    // then build the registry
    .build();

// Remember to tell NeoForge about your registry! For example:
modEventBus.addListener(NewRegistryEvent.class, event -> event.register(CUSTOM_REGISTRY));
```

## That's it!
As usual, ask on our Discord server in the `#modder-support-1.20` channel if you have any question.
